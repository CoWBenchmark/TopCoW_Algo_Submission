# TopCoW Algorithm Submit Template for Task 1: CoW Multiclass Segmentation 🐮

## TLDR

* **If you want more flexibility (i.e. customize this repo beyond `your_algorithm.py` file or not using this template repo at all)**, then simply ensure that your docker container can:
  1. read from the input interface that supplies **two `.mha` images**:

        > Head MR Angiography (Image) at **`/input/images/head-mr-angio/<uuid>.mha`**
        >
        > Head CT Angiography (Image) at **`/input/images/head-ct-angio/<uuid>.mha`**

  2. write to the output interface **one `.mha` segmentation mask**:

        > Circle of Willis Multiclass Segmentation (Segmentation) to **`/output/images/cow-multiclass-segmentation/<uuid>.mha`**


* **If you are new to the GC submission system**, we recommend that you use this repo as a template, **which only requires a few simple steps to build a submission container!**
The steps are easily done, and you just follow the `TODO` in one file!

    1. Add your algorithm by editing the **`./your_algorithm.py`** file
    3. Submit your algorithm by
        - either linking a **private** repo let GC build the container in the cloud
        - or use `./export.sh` to create a `tar.gz` of your docker container and upload to GC
        - GC documentation on the above two options: [how to deploy your container](https://grand-challenge.org/documentation/test-and-deploy-your-container/)


  For more information on **using this repo as a template, please refer to [Use This Repo as a Template](#use-this-repo-as-a-template)**


* **Submission portal links**. We have 4 submission portals for task 1. Two submission portals for the validation phase, and two for the final-test phase, one for each track:
    * Submit to [Validation CTA Task 1 Seg](https://topcow24.grand-challenge.org/evaluation/validation-cta-task-1-seg/submissions/create/)
    * Submit to [Validation MRA Task 1 Seg](https://topcow24.grand-challenge.org/evaluation/validation-mra-task-1-seg/submissions/create/)
    * Submit to [Final Test CTA Task 1 Seg](https://topcow24.grand-challenge.org/evaluation/finaltest-cta-task-1-seg/submissions/create/)
    * Submit to [Final Test MRA Task 1 Seg](https://topcow24.grand-challenge.org/evaluation/finaltest-mra-task-1-seg/submissions/create/)

    Please use the validation submission portals to make sure your docker containers work as intended.
    You can submit to validation phases with a daily limit until they close.
    But final test phases only allow for maximal one or two submissions.

## Use This Repo as a Template

### Edit `./your_algorithm.py`

You can then adapt the `your_algorithm.py` file. We have marked the most relevant parts you need to change with **`TODO`**.

Simply specify `TRACK` on top of the `your_algorithm.py` file:

```python
# TODO: 
# Choose your TRACK. Track is either 'MR' or 'CT'.
TRACK = 'MR' # or 'CT'
```

Finally, in the `your_segmentation_algorithm()` function, implement your inference algorithm there, and whatever you do,
**just return us an `numpy array`** of the same shape as the main input image. We will handle the rest of the file conversion and output saving etc from there onwards.

```python
def your_segmentation_algorithm(*, mr_input_array: np.array, ct_input_array: np.array) -> np.array:
    """
    args:
        mr_input_array: np.array - input image for MR track
        ct_input_array: np.array - input image for CT track
    returns:
        np.array - prediction
    """

    # TODO: place your own prediction algorithm here
    model = ...
    device = ...
    ...
    model.predict(ct_input_array)
    ...
    # END OF TODO

    # return prediction array
    return pred_array
```

#### Requirement for `your_segmentation_algorithm()` output array shape

For each test case the output of your algorithm must be a prediction array either for the CT or the MR image (depending on the track).

Your predictions are only evaluated within the ROI containing the CoW. In order for the ROIs of your predictions and the ground-truths to match, it's important that **your output mask array must have the same shape as the input image of the modality of the track you submit for**.

Under the hood in our `inference.py` your pred_array needs to pass the following test:
```python
assert pred_array.shape == required_output_shape
```

#### Running inference

You can run inference locally by executing the script `inference.py`. The `inference.py` also serves as the entrypoint for the Docker container. 

**NOTE: You don't need to change anything in the `inference.py` script.**

### Testing and deploying Docker container

Update your `requirements.txt` for your required python libraries.

Make the necessary changes to the `Dockerfile`:

* Choose a suitable base image if necessary to build your container (e.g., Tensorflow or Pytorch or even Ubuntu, or a different version of Python base image)
* Make sure that all required source files (such as model weights and python scripts) are copied to the Docker container with `COPY` in your `Dockerfile`

```docker
COPY --chown=user:user <somefile> /opt/app/
```

#### **Test your container!**

**Highly recommended to test your container by `bash test_run.sh` locally**. This will mimic the GC docker running environment and input to your docker container any mha files you provide in the `./test/input` folder. It will check the output predictions against what you provide in `./test/expected_output/`:

```bash
# TODO: Provide the expected output segmentation mask of your algorithm in ./test/expected_output/
# TODO: In the python code snippet below change the following if necessary:

IMAGE_FILENAME="output.mha"
EXPECTED_SEG_MASK="expected_output_dummy_mra.mha"
```

**Feel free to change the pair of test images in `test/input/images/head-ct-angio/` and `test/input/images/head-mr-angio/`, and the corresponding expected output in `test/expected_output` to validate your algorithm works as intended**.

**Feel free to change the pair of test images in `test/input/images/head-ct-angio/` and `test/input/images/head-mr-angio/`**.

**Note:** the scripts work on a case-by-case basis. So, there should only be 1 CT image and 1 MR image in the corresponding input folders.

Currently, you find `test/input/images/head-ct-angio/example_input_dummy_cta.mha` and `test/input/images/head-mr-angio/example_input_dummy_mra.mha` in the input folder.

### Export and Deploy

If you choose to upload your container to GC directly (instead of linking a private Github repo, see above TLDR), then run `save.sh` to package your docker container image. This will create a `.tar.gz` file ready for upload to one of our GC submission portals.

**NOTE: it is a good idea to rename the default generated file with a more informative name, since we have 2 tracks:**

```bash
mv algo_docker_task-1_seg_<timestamp>.tar.gz <some_info>_<track>_task-1_seg_<timestamp>.tar.gz
```

### Making a Challenge Submission

Please refer to the GC documentation on ["Submitting your Algorithm container"](https://grand-challenge.org/documentation/making-a-challenge-submission/#submitting-your-algorithm-container), espeically the ["Submission tips"](https://grand-challenge.org/documentation/making-a-challenge-submission/#submission-tips).

_NOTE: It is recommended to use the GC to "Try Out Algorithm" first:_
> Once your container is active, please test it out before submitting it to the challenge, you can upload data using the "Try Out Algorithm" button. Please use a representative image and check that the outputs are what you expect. You can inspect the error messages on the Results page of your algorithm.

And that is it! 🤠
All the best for the submission process.
Please reach out to us by leaving an issue on this repo or on our challenge forum.
